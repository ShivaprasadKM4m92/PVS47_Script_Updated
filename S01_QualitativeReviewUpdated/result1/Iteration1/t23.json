On 18-MAY-1999, the patient was screened for entry into a study, title as stated above. The patient's screening physical examination revealed the limitation of movement in the left hip due to arthritis, and a neurologic examination and vital signs were normal or not clinically significant. The patient's electrocardiogram revealed a sinus bradycardia with arrhythmias which were not clinically significant, and the screening laboratory values were normal except for the following: neutrophils; 82.8%, lymphocyte; 9.5%, and thyroxine 16.3 mcg/dl. On 28-MAY-1999, the patient took the first dose of study therapy, and was allocated to receive either rofecoxib, tablet, 25 mg, daily, or placebo, for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Concomitant therapy included levothyroxine sodium  (Synthroid), ascorbic acid, pyridoxine, brinzolamide, dorzolamide HCl(MSD), ginkgo biloba extract, and unspecified estrogenic preparations. On 14-JUL-1999, the patient's laboratory results were normal except for an elevated glucose level of 165 mg/dl. On 10-SEP-1999, the patient suffered a fall and hurt her neck, which was reported as a non-serious event. On 11-SEP-1999, the patient was found in her apartment, at the assisted living facility, on the bathroom floor, and she was alert, confused, and agitated. The patient was complaining of back discomfort, was taken to the hospital, and admitted with generalized weakness. Blinded study therapy was discontinued at this time, the last dose was taken on 10-SEP-1999. An X-ray of the cervical spine revealed degenerative changes and no acute injury. A head computed axial tomography scan without contrast showed atrophy, diffuse nonspecific white matter changes, and no acute pathology. The patient was started on therapy with buspirone  hydrochloride (Buspar). The patient's vital signs upon admission were as follows: temperature 97, pulse 88 and regular, respirations 20, and blood pressure 150/80. The patient had mild tenderness over the cervical spine, and was otherwise supple with no venous jugular distension. Carotid upstroke was normal, heart rate had regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or rubs appreciated. Laboratory data showed a normal complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 7.51. During the patient's hospital stay, she had episodes of agitation and combativeness secondary to Alzheimer's Disease, and the patient was treated with haloperidol (Haldol) as needed. Therapy with levothyroxine sodium was increased to 150 micrograms daily and a repeat TSH was to be repeated two weeks after discharge. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular and pulmonary standpoint throughout the hospitalization. On 15-SEP-1999, the patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for  intensive nursing care and other supportive care. The patient was discharged on therapies with buspirone hydrochloride, levothyroxine sodium, haloperidol, conjugated estrogenic hormones (Premarin), and docusate sodium (Colace). On 20-SEP-1999, the patient withdrew from the study. The reporting physician felt that the muscular weakness was an other important medical event and was definitely not related to blinded study therapy.

After consultation her physician stated the eye running was a wet eye condition due to her age and she continued therapy with dorazolamide hcl . Subsequently the patient experienced inflammed eye and lids which caused a lot of pain and discomfort which gradually worsened. In November 1998 the patient was diagnosed as having conjunctivitus of both eyes which were full of pus. The patient continued therapy with dorazolamide hcl. During subsequent consultations with a physician the patient's therapy regime was changed, and she was placed on other eyedrops and \"jelly\" (not specified), the patient continued therapy with dorazolamide hcl.The patient stated she was in a \"fog\" which worsened. In  February 1999 the patients therapy regime was changed but she continued the therapy with dorazolamide hcl. The patient's fog,inflamed eyes and lids persisted. On 16-MAR-1999 the patient's physician said she did not have a wet eye condition but a dry eye one, and stated dorazolamide hcl was aggravating the dry eye condition.

Concomitant therapy included brimonidine d-tartrate (Alphagan) for the treatment of glaucoma (dose unknown). On 12-OCT-1999 the patient's intraocular pressure (IOP) was 32/32 (normal range not specified). The physician stated that the Alphagan did not control the IOP, so therapy with dorzolamide HCL was added \"giving good IOP control\". On 26-OCT-1999 the patient's IOP was 20/14 (normal range not specified). On 06-NOV-1999 the patient experienced a drug reaction - extreme irritation first in one eye and the next day in both eyes. The patient reported that the extreme irritation was accompanied by an amount of viscid fluid. On 09-NOV-1999 the patient's IOP was 30/30  (normal range not specified). On 09-NOV-1999 therapy with dorzolamide hcl and Alphagan was discontinued. Therapy with latanoprost (Xalatan) was initiated for the treatment of glaucoma (date and dose not reported). On 21-DEC-1999 the patient's IOP was 19/19 (normal range not specified). The physician stated that the patient's IOP is currently controlled on Xalatan. The physician felt that it was not known whether the drug reaction-extreme irritation was related to therapy with dorzolamide HCl but stated \"I cannot say which agent.
